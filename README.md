This is the official code of FedWiper. 

We build a new federated unlearning framework that can achieve 100% unlearning in a federated setting.

Furthermore, we propose a Uni-Adapter structure, which can greatly compensate for the performance loss of the model 
caused by unlearning. The significant advantage of Uni-Adapter in FedWiper lies in its ability to solve machine
unlearning on multiple types of tasks.
